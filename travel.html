        5 years ago I boarded a cruise ship for the first time. We traveled to Puerto Rico, Domincan
        Republic, and a private island in the Bahamas. I had the best time! It was the first time I
        traveled outside of the United States. We were planning to board another cruise last year
        but the pandemic cancelled those plans. Hopefully, we'll be able to plan another cruise in a
        few years.
