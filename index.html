    <h1>Family Life</h1>
    <p>
      I was born in Nashville and raised in Clarksville. I went to high school at Kenwood High
      School, where I found an interest in coding. I'm married with two beautiful girls, aged 2 and
      5.
    </p>
    <h1>Education</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a <i>Junior</i> at Austin Peay State University. I'm majoring in Computer Information
      Technology. I enjoy creating websites using mock up designs on figma. I aspire to become a
      <b>Front End Developer</b> because I love to bring a UX design to life. When I'm not creating
      webpages, I'm learning game developement on Unity. I have many game ideas that I want to
      execute.
    </p>
    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>
      Outside of technology, I enjoy sewing. I recently bought an industrial machine to begin making
      handbags for my two daughters. Currently, I sew all of their clothes for school. I love how
      unique their wardrobe is. My next challenge is to sew their school bags and lunch bags for the
      next school year.
